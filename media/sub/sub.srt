00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,400
I'm at a payphone trying to call home

1
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,700
All of my change, I've spent on you

2
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,100
Where have the times gone?

3
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,100
Baby, it's all wrong

4
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,000
Where are the plans we made for two?

5
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,800
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,300
The people we used to be.

7
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,600
it's even harder to picture

8
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,700
That you're not here next to me

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,900
You say it's too late to make it

10
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,100
But is it too late to try?

11
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,000
And in our time that you wasted

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,900
All of our bridges burned down

13
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,400
I've wasted my nights

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,800
You turned out the lights

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,200
Now I'm paralyzed

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
Still stuck in that time when
we called it love

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,600
But even the sun sets in paradise.

18
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,800
I'm at a payphone trying to call home

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,900
All of my change, I've spent on you

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,200
Where have the times gone?

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Baby, it's all wrong

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,800
Where are the plans we made for two?

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If happy ever after did exist

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,400
I would still be holding you like this

25
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,800
All those fairy tales are full of shit

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,300
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick

27
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,000
You turned your back on tomorrow

28
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,900
'Cause you forgot yesterday

29
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,400
I gave you my love to borrow

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
But you just gave it away

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
You can't expect me to be fine

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,900
I don't expect you to care

33
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,500
I know I said it before

34
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,700
But all of our bridges burned down

35
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,500
I've wasted my nights

36
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,700
You turned out the lights

37
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,800
Now I'm paralyzed

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,200
Still stuck in that time when
we called it love

39
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,600
But even the sun sets in paradise.

40
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,400
I'm at a payphone trying to call home

41
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,800
All of my change, I spent on you

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Where have the times gone

43
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Baby, it's all wrong

44
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,500
Where are the plans we made for two?

45
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,800
If happy ever after did exist

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,200
I would still be holding you like this

47
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,500
All those fairy tales are full of shit

48
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,600
One more stupid love song I'll be sick

49
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,600
Now I'm at a payphone.

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Man, fuck that shit

51
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
I'll be out spending all this money

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
While you're sitting 'round wondering

53
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,600
Why it wasn't you who came up
from nothing

54
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Made it from the bottom

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Now when you see me I'm stuntin'

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,000
And all cars start with the
push of a button

57
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,400
Telling me the chances I blew
up or whatever you call it

58
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,500
Switch the number to my phone
so you never could call it

59
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,700
Don't need my name on my show,
you can tell it I'm ballin

60
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,000
Swish, what a shame, could
have got picked

61
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Had a really good game but you
missed your last shot

62
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,000
So you talk about who you see at the top

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Or what you could have saw

64
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,300
But sad to say it's over for

65
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,600
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors

66
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Wiz like go away, got what you
was looking for

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,200
Now it's me who they want

68
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,100
So you can go and take that
little piece of shit with you

69
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,300
I'm at a payphone trying to call home

70
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,400
All of my change, I spent on you

71
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,800
Where have the times gone

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,200
Baby, it's all wrong, where
are the plans we made for two

73
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,700
If happy ever after did exist

74
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,000
I would still be holding you like this

75
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,200
And all these fairy tales are
full of shit

76
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,500
Yeah, one more stupid love
song, I'll be sick

77
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,700
Now I'm at a payphone.
